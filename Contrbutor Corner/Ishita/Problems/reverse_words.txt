Problem:Given a String of length N reverse each word in it. Words are separated by dots.
Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case contains a string containing dots and characters.
 Output:
For each test case, output a String in single line containing the reversed words of the given String.
Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=Length of String<=2000
Example:
Input:
2
i.like.this.program.very.much
pqr.mno
Output:
i.ekil.siht.margorp.yrev.hcum
rqp.onm
Time and Space Complexity:
time: O(n)
space:O(n)
where n is size of string
Approach: Push each character in a stack if it’s not equal to “.” .Pop elements when “.” is found.
Pseudocode: stack<char>s; 
  for (i = 0 to str.length())
	 { 
        if (str[i] != '.') 
            s.push(str[i])
  
        else { 
            
			while (s.empty() == false)
			 { 
Print(s.top()) 
                s.pop()
            } 
       Print(.)
        }
